How to Protect Your Business Cyber Incident Response Plan
When people hear "cyber incident response," they often imagine something dramatic. A team of hackers breaking into a server, alarms blaring, and a frantic race to stop them. In reality, it's less cinematic. But it's also much more important. A good Cyber Incident Response Plan (CIRP) doesn't just help you respond to incidents; it keeps your organization alive.
What It's For
A CIRP is about preparation. It's like a fire drill for cyberattacks. If something happens - and it will - you already know what to do. It aligns with guidelines from the Scottish Government, so it's not just a document sitting on a shelf. It's a living thing, connected to larger strategies for resilience and readiness.
But it's also limited. A CIRP doesn't cover every IT hiccup. A printer breaking down? Not a cyber incident. Even most software bugs don't qualify. This plan kicks in when there's intent. When someone, somewhere, tries to mess with your systems or steal your data.
Who Does What?
People need clear roles in an emergency. The CIRP defines these. There's the Core Incident Response Team (CIRT), made up of people from IT, legal, HR, communications, and finance. These are the first responders. Then there's the Crisis Management Team (CMT). They deal with the big-picture stuff: business continuity, reputational risk, and strategic decisions.
To keep it all clear, the CIRP uses a RACI Matrix. This tool shows who's Responsible, who's Accountable, who needs to be Consulted, and who should be Informed. It stops confusion before it starts.
Talking During Chaos
Communication in a crisis is tricky. If your email system is compromised, how do you share updates? The CIRP plans for this. It sets up alternate communication channels so people can still connect.
It also decides who gets notified and when. Managers need to know about severe incidents. HR steps in for employee breaches. Legal handles cases where someone might be prosecuted. And external parties - like regulators or vendors - are looped in if necessary.
How It Works
The CIRP breaks down the response into steps. Each step matters because each one builds on the last.
Preparation
You can't wing it. Before an incident, you need playbooks, system diagrams, and training. Everyone should know what to do, not just in theory but through practice. Run exercises. Test the systems. This isn't optional.
Identify and Report
Someone notices something wrong. They report it. This could be anything from phishing emails to a DDoS attack. The CIRP has a system for figuring out how serious the problem is and who needs to act.
Analyse and Investigate
Not every incident is a big deal. But when it is, you need to understand it fast. The CIRP uses a severity matrix to figure out the impact. Is it catastrophic or minor? This isn't guesswork - it's a structured process.
Containment
Once you know what's happening, you stop it from spreading. Maybe that means isolating a network or cutting off access for certain users. Speed is key here.
Eradication
Containment isn't enough. You need to fix the root problem. Remove malware, patch vulnerabilities, and make sure it doesn't happen again. This is where a lot of the hard work happens.
Recovery
Getting back to normal takes time. You can't rush this. Systems need to be tested, monitored, and scanned for lingering issues.
Reporting and Learning
After it's over, you reflect. What went wrong? What worked? The CIRP includes a process for creating detailed reports within five days. These reports aren't just paperwork - they're tools for getting better.

The Tools
The CIRP isn't just a plan. It's a kit. It includes guides for forensic imaging (so evidence stands up in court) and detailed contact lists. It even has a reporting form specifically designed for the Scottish Government.
The appendices are like cheat sheets. They include everything from acronyms to categorization frameworks. These small details make a big difference when the pressure is on.
Why It Matters
Most people think a CIRP is about reacting. But it's really about preparing. It's about creating a system that doesn't panic, even when everything is falling apart. Preparation isn't glamorous, but it works. With clear roles, structured communication, and a tested plan, you can handle almost anything.
That's what makes a CIRP valuable. It doesn't promise perfection. It promises readiness. And that's enough.
