When people hear "cyber incident response," they often imagine something dramatic. A team of hackers breaking into a server, alarms blaring, and a frantic race to stop them. In reality, it's less cinematic. But it's also much more important. A good Cyber Incident Response Plan (CIRP) doesn't just help you respond to incidents; it keeps your organization alive.

**What It's For**
A CIRP is about preparation. It's like a fire drill for cyberattacks. If something happens - and it will - you already know what to do. It aligns with guidelines from the Scottish Government, so it's not just a document sitting on a shelf. It's a living thing, connected to larger strategies for resilience and readiness.
But it's also limited. A CIRP doesn't cover every IT hiccup. A printer breaking down? Not a cyber incident. Even most software bugs don't qualify. This plan kicks in when there's intent. When someone, somewhere, tries to mess with your systems or steal your data.

**Who Does What?**
People need clear roles in an emergency. The CIRP defines these. There's the Core Incident Response Team (CIRT), made up of people from IT, legal, HR, communications, and finance. These are the first responders. Then there's the Crisis Management Team (CMT). They deal with the big-picture stuff: business continuity, reputational risk, and strategic decisions.
To keep it all clear, the CIRP uses a RACI Matrix. This tool shows who's Responsible, who's Accountable, who needs to be Consulted, and who should be Informed. It stops confusion before it starts.

**Talking During Chaos**
Communication in a crisis is tricky. If your email system is compromised, how do you share updates? The CIRP plans for this. It sets up alternate communication channels so people can still connect.
It also decides who gets notified and when. Managers need to know about severe incidents. HR steps in for employee breaches. Legal handles cases where someone might be prosecuted. And external parties - like regulators or vendors - are looped in if necessary.
